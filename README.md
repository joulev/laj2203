# `laj2203`

This website is created to host all of my learning journal for LAJ2203
“Japanese 4” at National University of Singapore.

It was started at my professor's recommendation, and is now used to record
all my thoughts after any lectures or tutorials in the module.

The website is written in React, and is my very first React project. Hence there
will definitely be a lot of bad practices and mistakes, but I will try to
improve it as I learn more about React.
