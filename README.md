# LAJ2203 Learning Journal

This website is created to host all of my learning journal for LAJ2203
“Japanese 4” at National University of Singapore.

It was started at my professor's recommendation, and is now used to record
all my thoughts after any lectures or tutorials in the module.

The website is written in React, and is my very first React project. Hence there
will definitely be a lot of bad practices and mistakes, but I will try to
improve it as I learn more about React.

There is a previous version of the website, written with Jekyll. It was the
repository where I updated the journals weekly. Since the React version is so
different from the Jekyll version in terms of source code, I decided to just
purge every commit of the old files away and start over with a clean repository
when I set up the React version. However, you can still view the old source
[here](https://github.com/joulev/laj2203/tree/16d12452648a5d7810cae960d65881fe0d1f8c40).
